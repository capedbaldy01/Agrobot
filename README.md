# Agrobot
 Prototype for an industry grade Agricultural Robot capable of remotely performing spraying and weeding operations

The complete physical structure is broadly divided into 4 major parts
1. CHASSIS
2. DRIVE MODULE
3. WEED REMOVER
4. SPRAYER

Each module is explained in the Mechanical project [Report](https://github.com/capedbaldy01/Agrobot/blob/main/Agrobot-mechanical-report.pdf)

There are two iterations of the model, with changes to the weeder mechanism, the spraying system and optmizing the load capacity and endurance of the bot.
